"GD-enhancing tumor and necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core in an MRI Image","Irregular and heterogeneous mass with a mix of solid, enhancing, and necrotic components.","Located within the brain parenchyma, often at the tumor's center with necrosis in the middle and enhancing areas at the periphery.","Necrotic core appears hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, while enhancing portions are hyperintense on contrast-enhanced T1 images.","Irregular and poorly defined outer margins blending into adjacent brain tissue.","Heterogeneous internal texture with sharply contrasting enhancing tumor and necrotic core areas."
"Peritumoral edema, GD-enhancing tumor, and necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core in an MRI Image","Large irregular region encompassing the tumor core with surrounding edema extending into adjacent white matter.","Located around the central tumor mass, extending into surrounding brain tissue.","Edema appears hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR, enhancing tumor portions appear bright on contrast-enhanced T1, and necrotic core appears hypointense.","Ill-defined outer boundary due to edema infiltration, while enhancing tumor margins may appear more distinct in contrast imaging.","Heterogeneous internal texture combining solid enhancing tumor, central necrosis, and diffuse surrounding edema."
"GD-enhancing tumor in an MRI Image","Irregularly shaped enhancing mass, often nodular or ring-enhancing.","Located within the tumor core, usually adjacent to necrotic or non-enhancing areas.","Hyperintense on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, with sharp contrast against non-enhancing regions.","Partially well-defined margins in contrast imaging, though often irregular and infiltrative at the edges.","Relatively homogeneous internal texture in smaller tumors, but may appear heterogeneous in larger or more aggressive lesions."
