"Title","Shape","Location","Appearance/Density","Contour/Symmetry","Internal Texture"
"Spleen in a CT Image","Ovoid or crescent-shaped with a smooth outer surface.","Located in the left upper quadrant, lateral to the stomach and superior to the left kidney.","Soft-tissue density with homogeneous enhancement after contrast administration.","Well-defined smooth contour, slightly convex on the lateral side and concave medially.","Homogeneous fine-grained internal texture under normal conditions."
"Right Kidney in a CT Image","Bean-shaped with a slightly concave medial border where the hilum is located.","Positioned in the right retroperitoneum, inferior to the liver and lateral to the inferior vena cava.","Intermediate soft-tissue density with a hypodense central collecting system.","Smooth and well-defined outer contour with subtle lobulations in young individuals.","Cortex appears homogeneous, while the medulla may show striated texture due to pyramids."
"Left Kidney in a CT Image","Bean-shaped with a slightly concave medial border where the hilum is located.","Positioned in the left retroperitoneum, inferior to the spleen and lateral to the aorta.","Intermediate soft-tissue density with a hypodense central collecting system.","Smooth and well-defined outer contour with subtle lobulations in young individuals.","Cortex appears homogeneous, while the medulla may show striated texture due to pyramids."
"Gallbladder in a CT Image","Pear-shaped, elongated sac with variable size depending on fullness.","Located in the right upper quadrant, inferior to the liver and anterior to the right kidney.","Low-density lumen when filled with bile; walls may enhance with contrast.","Thin-walled with smooth outer contour when normal.","Homogeneous and hypodense when filled with bile; may appear heterogeneous if containing sludge or stones."
"Esophagus in a CT Image","Tubular and elongated structure with a uniform diameter.","Extends from the pharynx through the thorax, posterior to the trachea and anterior to the spine.","Soft-tissue density with an air-filled or fluid-filled lumen depending on phase.","Smooth outer contour with slight narrowing at physiological constrictions.","Homogeneous soft-tissue texture with occasional air pockets in the lumen."
"Liver in a CT Image","Large, wedge-shaped organ with a right-dominant lobe structure.","Occupies the right upper quadrant, extending across the midline into the left upper quadrant.","Soft-tissue density, enhancing homogeneously with contrast except for vascular structures.","Smooth and well-defined contour with sharp edges.","Homogeneous parenchymal texture with visible vascular branching patterns."
"Stomach in a CT Image","J-shaped, hollow structure with variable size depending on distension.","Located in the upper abdomen, between the esophagus and the duodenum.","Variable density depending on content; mucosa enhances with contrast.","Smooth outer contour with rugal folds visible when distended.","Layered internal structure with visible gastric folds in well-distended states."
"Aorta in a CT Image","Cylindrical tubular structure with a consistent diameter along its course.","Originates from the left ventricle, ascending, arching, and descending through the thorax and abdomen.","High-density lumen when filled with contrast, surrounded by a thin soft-tissue wall.","Smooth and circular contour under normal conditions.","Homogeneous lumen appearance with smooth walls."
"Inferior Vena Cava in a CT Image","Large, thin-walled tubular structure with a slightly compressible lumen.","Runs along the right side of the spine, returning blood to the right atrium.","Variable density depending on contrast phase; typically lower density than arteries.","Smooth and well-defined contour with a slightly irregular shape due to adjacent structures.","Homogeneous internal texture with no visible internal striations in normal cases."
"Pancreas in a CT Image","Elongated, lobulated structure with a tapering tail.","Located in the retroperitoneum, extending from the duodenum to the spleen.","Soft-tissue density with mild contrast enhancement.","Irregular but well-defined contour with a lobulated appearance.","Heterogeneous fine-grained internal texture due to glandular lobules."
"Right Adrenal Gland in a CT Image","Small, triangular or Y-shaped gland with an irregular outline.","Sits atop the right kidney in the retroperitoneum, near the inferior vena cava.","Soft-tissue density, enhancing mildly with contrast.","Thin, irregular contour that follows the kidney’s superior pole.","Heterogeneous internal texture with a mixture of cortical and medullary components."
"Left Adrenal Gland in a CT Image","Small, triangular or Y-shaped gland with an irregular outline.","Sits atop the left kidney in the retroperitoneum, near the aorta.","Soft-tissue density, enhancing mildly with contrast.","Thin, irregular contour that follows the kidney’s superior pole.","Heterogeneous internal texture with a mixture of cortical and medullary components."
"Duodenum in a CT Image","C-shaped hollow structure wrapping around the pancreas.","Located in the upper abdomen, connecting the stomach to the jejunum.","Variable density depending on contents; contrast fills the lumen well.","Smooth outer contour with visible folds in contrast-enhanced studies.","Layered texture with visible mucosal folds when distended."
"Bladder in a CT Image","Round or oval-shaped hollow organ with a thin wall.","Located in the pelvic region, anterior to the rectum and superior to the prostate/uterus.","Low-density lumen when filled with urine; walls may enhance with contrast.","Smooth outer contour when fully distended, may appear irregular when empty.","Homogeneous and hypodense when filled with urine; may show layering if debris is present."
"Prostate/Uterus in a CT Image","Prostate: Small, rounded, and glandular structure; Uterus: Pear-shaped and muscular.","Prostate: Inferior to the bladder and anterior to the rectum; Uterus: Superior to the bladder and midline in the pelvis.","Prostate: Soft-tissue density with mild enhancement; Uterus: Homogeneous enhancement depending on phase.","Prostate: Well-defined and smooth contour; Uterus: Smooth, rounded contour with possible endometrial stripe.","Prostate: Homogeneous texture with glandular features; Uterus: Layered texture with endometrial and myometrial differentiation."
