Title,Shape,Location,Appearance/Density,Contour/Symmetry,Internal Texture
Left Ventricle in a CT Image,Oval-like shape with thick walls tapering slightly towards the apex.,"Positioned on the left side of the heart, below the left atrium, and anterior to the descending aorta.",High-density muscular wall visible due to contrast enhancement; the lumen appears lower in density when filled with blood or contrast agent.,Smooth and well-defined contour with symmetrical walls on both sides of the cavity.,Relatively homogenous muscular structure with striations sometimes visible in the myocardium.
Right Ventricle in a CT Image,Crescent-like shape with thinner walls compared to the left ventricle.,"Positioned on the right side of the heart, anterior and slightly medial to the left ventricle.","Lower-density walls compared to the left ventricle, with the lumen often appearing darker due to blood or contrast agent.","Less defined contour compared to the left ventricle, with asymmetrical wall thickness.",Slightly heterogeneous texture due to the trabeculae carneae lining the inner surface.
Left Atrium in a CT Image,Elliptical or spherical chamber with relatively thin walls.,Superior to the left ventricle and posterior to the right atrium.,"Thin, low-density walls with a central lumen that appears darker due to blood or contrast.",Smooth and round contours with uniform wall thickness.,Homogeneous texture without significant visible features due to the smooth inner lining.
Right Atrium in a CT Image,Irregularly rounded chamber with thin walls.,"Positioned on the right side of the heart, inferior to the superior vena cava and anterior to the spine.","Thin-walled structure, appearing darker inside due to blood or contrast agent in the lumen.",Smooth outer contour with occasional indentations from adjacent structures.,"Homogeneous, with subtle trabeculated patterns on the inner wall."
Myocardium of Left Ventricle in a CT Image,"Thick, continuous ring encircling the left ventricle lumen.","Forms the outer wall of the left ventricle, encasing the cavity symmetrically.",High-density tissue due to contrast enhancement; appears bright compared to the lumen.,Smooth and well-defined contour with consistent thickness along the circumference.,Homogeneous and dense with no apparent granularity under normal conditions.
Ascending Aorta in a CT Image,Cylindrical tubular structure tapering slightly as it extends superiorly.,"Anterior and slightly to the right of the heart, originating from the left ventricle.","High-density circular lumen when filled with contrast, surrounded by a thin wall of intermediate density.","Smooth, circular contour with no irregularities in healthy conditions.",Homogeneous appearance of the lumen with smooth walls.
Pulmonary Artery in a CT Image,Cylindrical tubular structure branching into left and right main pulmonary arteries.,Anterior to the left atrium and posterior to the ascending aorta.,"Contrast-enhanced lumen appears bright, surrounded by thin, lower-density walls.",Smooth and rounded contour with clear bifurcation into the left and right branches.,"Homogeneous lumen texture with smooth, non-thickened walls under normal conditions."
