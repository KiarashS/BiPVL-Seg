"Title","Shape","Location","Appearance/Density","Contour/Symmetry","Internal Texture"
"Left Ventricle in an MRI Image","Oval-like shape with thick walls tapering slightly towards the apex.","Positioned on the left side of the heart, below the left atrium, and anterior to the descending aorta.","Appears hyperintense in blood-pool imaging (steady-state free precession), with myocardium appearing intermediate or dark depending on sequence.","Smooth and well-defined contour with symmetrical walls on both sides of the cavity.","Homogeneous myocardium with visible trabeculations and papillary muscles in cine MRI sequences."
"Right Ventricle in an MRI Image","Crescent-shaped with thinner walls compared to the left ventricle.","Located on the right side of the heart, anterior and slightly medial to the left ventricle.","Blood pool appears bright in SSFP, while the myocardium is intermediate to dark in delayed contrast imaging.","Less defined contour compared to the left ventricle, with asymmetrical wall thickness.","Heterogeneous internal texture with prominent trabeculations along the inner surface."
"Left Atrium in an MRI Image","Elliptical or spherical chamber with relatively thin walls.","Located superior to the left ventricle and posterior to the right atrium.","Blood pool appears hyperintense on SSFP sequences; walls enhance mildly with contrast.","Smooth and round contours with uniform wall thickness.","Homogeneous texture without significant trabeculations."
"Right Atrium in an MRI Image","Irregularly rounded chamber with thin walls.","Positioned on the right side of the heart, inferior to the superior vena cava and anterior to the spine.","Hyperintense blood pool in steady-state imaging; walls are intermediate in intensity.","Smooth outer contour with occasional indentations from adjacent structures.","Homogeneous texture with subtle trabeculations near the entrance of the vena cava."
"Myocardium of Left Ventricle in an MRI Image","Thick, continuous ring encircling the left ventricle lumen.","Forms the outer wall of the left ventricle, encasing the cavity symmetrically.","Intermediate to dark in SSFP sequences; enhances with contrast in delayed imaging.","Smooth and well-defined contour with consistent thickness along the circumference.","Homogeneous muscular texture with visible fiber orientation in certain MRI sequences."
"Ascending Aorta in an MRI Image","Cylindrical tubular structure with a slightly tapered superior course.","Located anterior and slightly to the right of the heart, originating from the left ventricle.","Hyperintense blood pool in SSFP sequences; walls enhance with contrast.","Smooth and circular contour with no irregularities in healthy conditions.","Homogeneous internal appearance with smooth walls and laminar flow patterns visible in phase contrast imaging."
"Pulmonary Artery in an MRI Image","Cylindrical tubular structure branching into left and right main pulmonary arteries.","Located anterior to the left atrium and posterior to the ascending aorta.","Blood pool appears bright in SSFP sequences, while the walls may enhance with contrast.","Smooth and rounded contour with clear bifurcation into left and right branches.","Homogeneous internal texture with laminar flow patterns visible in velocity-encoded imaging."
